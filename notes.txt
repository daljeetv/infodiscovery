The first thing I am going to do is create a blank html page.
To do this, I add a view in views.py and a url pattern in urls.py

So far, I have been debugging by testing a website, seeing an error, and fixing for that error.
For every error fixed, I added logging.

Now, I get a list of links for a given page and store that in a pickle file on the server.

I need to create an object for the website. This object has: 
    List of Websites 
        1. Frequency
        2. Alexa Rank
